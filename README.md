## [Project 1: Excel Analysis of Key Performance Indicators of New York Stock Exchange Companies ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1i7UUGJv8pdIeT9Cs8oWsVd0-LMl1kUaM)
 
 This Project was built to analyse NYSE data using Google Sheets. I initially cleaned the data by sorting and filtering. Created a P/L Dashboard of 35 companies from Year 1 - 4. This was interactive and easy to use by creating a drop down list of companies. Performed financial modelling using strong, base and weak case scenerios. These was achieved using index, match, offset and statistical formulars. Created descriptive statistics and bar charts to illustrate COGS and its differences between the Utility and Telecommunication sectors in NYSE companies.

It can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of forest conservation policies and initiatives.
