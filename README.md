## [Project 1: Customer Segmentation, Comparative Analysis, and Value of Used Cars](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/UsedCarsVisualizations/Dashboard1#1)
I looked at the value of used cars in 11 cities in India, using calculated fields to derive car values, pages, and filters, parameters to determine the most sought-after car towns based on power, engine, value, fuel type, and owner type. 

* Sourced market research-focused data from open sources. 
* Uploaded data on Tableau Public.
* Cleaned data and categorised it into the necessary fields like text and number values. 
* Visualised the best-used car model using a bar chart by owner type and fuel type, to be filtered by hierarchy or car names.
* Determined and visualized the locations with the most costly cars.
* Compared the year when the car was manufactured with drivers' choice of selecting a car as first, second, third, or above "owner type".

## [Project 2: Excel Analysis of Key Performance Indicators of New York Stock Exchange Companies ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FEdlSEeWfBA6r9amaltNMoB3ujbPTiVklPYjfiCyaAc/edit#gid=1969204835)
 
 This Project was built to analyse the Key Performance Indicators of Companies in NYSE. 
 
* Cleaned the data by sorting and filtering.
* Created a P/L Dashboard for 35 companies from Years 1 - 4.
* Made the dashboard interactive by creating a drop-down list of companies.
* Performed financial modeling using strong, base, and weak case scenarios.
* Utilized index, match, offset, and statistical formulas in the financial modeling process.
* Created descriptive statistics and bar charts to illustrate COGS and its differences between the Utility and Telecommunication sectors in NYSE companies.
 
## [Project 3: Deforestation Project via SQL](https://github.com/AO-Kareemat/Deforestation-Project.git)

This project was built to illustrate the impact of deforestation on different countries around the world by writing queries using MS SQL Servers. 

* Built a project to illustrate the impact of deforestation on different countries around the world.
* Used MS SQL Servers to write queries to understand the extent and dynamics of forest cover over the years.
* Used different questions to monitor changes in forest cover over time and give insight into the state of forests in different countries and regions.
* Generated answers to questions to evaluate the effectiveness of forest conservation policies and initiatives.
* Demonstrated the crucial role of effective forest management and conservation.

## [Project 4: US census Analysis Using Tableau](https://github.com/AO-Kareemat/TABLEAU-PROJECT.git)

This project was aimed to analyse the United States of America's census. 

* Visualized the best transportation system, average income, poverty rate, ethnicity, and labor in the US.
* Used various charts, sets, functions, and calculated fields to create interactive and engaging visualizations.
* Applied filters to refine data and provide different perspectives.
* Leveraged data visualization tools to provide insights and actionable recommendations.
