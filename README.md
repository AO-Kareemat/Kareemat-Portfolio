## [Project 1: Market Analysis, Market Research, and Advice on policy making for automotive cars in the United States](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bsCFo5-JLFRkKuKR_Ucda8O_pNAWton6tyJlefQn4x8/edit?usp=sharing)
Using Google sheets, I performed market research and analysis on the value of automotive cars in over 9 Colorado counties in 4 different quarters from 2008 to 2015.
* Prepared and cleaned data by removing duplicates, and validating the data.
* Utilised the sort and filter function to have a close look at specific quarters in the year and corresponding cities and sales figures to see how they performed over the years.
* Created vlookup function to find specific car price values in counties columns and return car prices from county and sales table arrays. 
* Used pivot chart to summarize, explore, and group total values of cars per quarter in each county to determine what quarter of the year we have the highest number of sales. 

## [Project 2: Customer Segmentation, Comparative Analysis, and Value of Used Cars](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/UsedCarsVisualizations/Dashboard1#1)
I looked at the value of used cars in 11 cities in India, using calculated fields to derive car values. Pages, filters, and parameters to determine the most sought-after car in towns based on power, engine, value, fuel type, and owner type. 

* Sourced market research-focused data from open sources. 
* Uploaded data on Tableau Public.
* Cleaned data and categorised it into the necessary fields like text and number values. 
* Visualised the best-used car model using a bar chart by owner and fuel type, to be filtered by hierarchy or car names.
* Determined and visualized the locations with the most costly cars.
* Compared the year the car was manufactured with drivers' choice of selecting a car as first, second, third, or above "owner type".

## [Project 3: Excel Analysis of Key Performance Indicators of New York Stock Exchange Companies ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FEdlSEeWfBA6r9amaltNMoB3ujbPTiVklPYjfiCyaAc/edit#gid=1969204835)
 
 This Project was built to analyse the Key Performance Indicators of Companies in NYSE. 
 
* Cleaned the data by sorting and filtering.
* Created a P/L Dashboard for 35 companies from Years 1 - 4.
* Made the dashboard interactive by creating a drop-down list of companies.
* Performed financial modeling using strong, base, and weak case scenarios.
* Utilized index, match, offset, and statistical formulas in the financial modeling process.
* Created descriptive statistics and bar charts to illustrate COGS and its differences between the Utility and Telecommunication sectors in NYSE companies.
 
## [Project 4: Deforestation Project via SQL](https://github.com/AO-Kareemat/Deforestation-Project.git)

This project was built to illustrate the impact of deforestation on different countries around the world by writing queries using MS SQL Servers. 

* Built a project to illustrate the impact of deforestation on different countries around the world.
* Used MS SQL Servers to write queries to understand the extent and dynamics of forest cover over the years.
* Used different questions to monitor changes in forest cover over time and give insight into the state of forests in different countries and regions.
* Generated answers to questions to evaluate the effectiveness of forest conservation policies and initiatives.
* Demonstrated the crucial role of effective forest management and conservation.

## [Project 5: US census Analysis Using Tableau](https://github.com/AO-Kareemat/TABLEAU-PROJECT.git)

This project aimed to analyse the United States of America's census. 

* Visualized the best transportation system, average income, poverty rate, ethnicity, and labor in the US.
* Used various charts, sets, functions, and calculated fields to create interactive and engaging visualizations.
* Applied filters to refine data and provide different perspectives.
* Leveraged data visualization tools to provide insights and actionable recommendations.
